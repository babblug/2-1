AIM: Stimulate all page replacement algorithms
(a)first in first out(FIFO)
DESCRIPTION:
The simplest page replacement algorithm is a first in first out(FIFO) 
algorithm. A FIFO replacement algorithm associates with each page the time when 
that page was brought into memory. When a page must be replaced, the oldest 
page is chosen. Notice that it is not strictly necessary to record the time when a 
page is brought in. we can create a FIFO queue to hold all pages in memory. We 
replace the page at head of queue. When a page is brought into memory, we insert 
it at the tail of queue.
In FIFO, Belady’s Anamoly might result in some cases i.e.,page fault rate 
may increase as the number of allocated frames increases. We would expect that 
giving morememory to a process would improve its performance. In some early 
research, investigators noticed that this assumption was not always true.
ALGORITHM:
1. Start
2.read the number of frames,length ofreference string and the reference string.
3.for i from 0 to n do
4.for j from 0 to f do
5. if p[j] is equal to r[i],break the for loop 80
6.push r[i] into stack and increment count
7.print pages in frames for each page in reference string
8.end
EXAMPLE:
Let the number of frames=3
And reference string is 1 2 3 2 5 4 3 2 1 3
1
2
Therefore, number of page faults=8
